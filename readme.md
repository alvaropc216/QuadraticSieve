# Selecting Sieving Interval and Factor Base
## Sieving
Sieving of Erasthothenes provides a very simple method of providing a list of primes up to a certain number n. 
## Quadratic Residue
Given an integer *n* and a prime modulus *p*, if *n* is relatively prime to *p* and if there exists and integer *t* such that: 
*n* &#8801 $t^2$ *mod* *p*

then we say that *n* is a **quadratic residue module *p* **.
